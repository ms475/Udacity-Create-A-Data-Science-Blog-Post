# Udacity-Create-A-Data-Science-Blog-Post
A basic analysis of the Boston Airbnb listings dataset to find various pricing trends.

## Synopsis
This notebook aims to find out various trends in pricing that can be seen in the different Airbnb listings in Boston, and tries to answer the following questions:
1. How do prices vary across the different regions in Boston?
2. How does pricing scale across different types of properties in Boston?
3. What are the most and least common amenities in Boston?
4. Can we create a simple model to attempt to predict prices in Boston, using simply neighbourhood and property data?

The results of this analysis have been summarized in this article: https://medium.com/@unstablereaper/airbnbs-in-boston-an-analysis-of-the-region-and-pricing-9d56696ea0b
